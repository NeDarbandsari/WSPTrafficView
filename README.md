Developing a Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) detection and localisation system using semantic segmentation techniques. Implementing the SLiMe (Segment Like Me) few-shot learning model, the intern project aimed to identify HGVs effectively with minimal data. 
Comparing results with YOLO V8, SAM and CLIPseg as they are.
WSPTrafficView.zip is dataset customised for SLiMe and WSPTrafficView2.zip is original dataset annotated by roboflow utilised for 3 other models.
